# Python Element Search

Another python console app. This one searches a list of integers and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether or not the integers are in `new_list`.

This one was tricky and I relied on the example solution for help. I did not attemp binary search as of this  commit.

I found the exercise <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/11/11/20-element-search.html">here</a> and the solution I cribbed from is <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/solution/2014/11/30/20-element-search-solutions.html">here.</a>
